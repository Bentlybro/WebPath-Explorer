# WebPath Explorer 🌐🔍

Welcome to *WebPath Explorer*, your gateway to uncovering the hidden connections of the web! 🕸️

⚠️ **Performance Notice**: Currently, with over 20-30,000 nodes and 60,000 edges (links between websites), the tool may experience lag. We're working on optimizing this for smoother experiences in future updates.

🔗 **Initiate the Journey**: Start by inputting a URL. Our tool springs into action, capturing every 'href' link on the page, weaving the first layer of this expansive web.

🌀 **Dive Deeper**: The exploration deepens as WebPath Explorer follows each link, repeating the process. You control how many layers deep it goes, unraveling the web's complex structure.

📊 **Visual Mapping**: The result is a dynamic visual graph, elegantly displaying the interconnectedness of websites. This bird's-eye view of web connections is perfect for those who want to understand the digital landscape.

🖱️ **Interactive Exploration**: Left-click on a node to start a search from that point, or right-click on a node to visit its webpage. Discover and navigate the web in a more intuitive and engaging way!

💻 **Getting Started**: To begin, `cd` into `WebPath Explorer`, run `python map.py`, then visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. After adding a website URL, check the terminal to see the traversal across sites. Note: The greater the 'max depth', the longer it takes to gather links and display the map. Your patience is appreciated as we continue to improve this tool!

🤝 **Join the Effort**: Contributions and pull requests are greatly appreciated! They play a crucial role in enhancing the capabilities of WebPath Explorer. Whether it's code optimization, new features, or bug fixes, your input helps us grow. Let's build a better tool together!
